# Hello World
- 👋 Hey, I’m @randomrevised!

## About me
- 👀 I'm interested in lots of topics as I'm just looking to broaden my experience - I'm eager to pick up anything that can help create tools/programs that can optimize workflow
- 🌱 In the fall, I'll be starting my studies in Applied Math and Computer Science at UC Berkeley
- 💞️ Hoping to improve my profile for Summer 2022 internships, so I'm trying to contribute at least a couple times per week. Let me know if there are any projects for first-time/newbie developers!

## Contact
- 📫 Coming soon!
